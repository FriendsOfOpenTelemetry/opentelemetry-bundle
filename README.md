> Traces, metrics, and logs instrumentation within your Symfony application.

## Overview

OpenTelemetry is an observability framework â€“ an API, SDK, and tools that are designed to aid in the generation and collection of application telemetry data such as metrics, logs, and traces.

For more information, visit the [OpenTelemetry PHP SDK documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/php/).

This bundle provides a seamless integration of the OpenTelemetry PHP SDK within your Symfony application.

## Documentation

## Versioning

This section outlines how pre-release versions will be published until the first stable release is achieved and the goals for each stage.

Backward compatibility will not be provided during pre-release stages, as our focus is on progressing toward the stable release. Consequently, breaking changes, such as package upgrades and configuration modifications, may occur without notice.

### Alpha

The goal of the Alpha release is to achieve full integration of the tracing, metering, and logging services provided by the OpenTelemetry SDK.

To accomplish this:

- All services and their dependencies must be fully declared in the bundle configuration.
- Services should be easily overridden by user-defined service definitions following Symfony's dependency injection principles.

Once the services are functional according to OpenTelemetry SDK capabilities and Symfony's service definitions, this phase will be complete.

### Beta

The goal of the Beta release is to enable tracing instrumentation for a Symfony application, either automatically or selectively.

Instrumentation goals include:

- Allowing instrumentation of Symfony components through defined entry points.
- Providing automatic (opt-out) instrumentation, where components are instrumented by default, with the option to exclude specific components.
- Enabling selective instrumentation, allowing users to explicitly choose which components to instrument through provided APIs.

For more details on instrumentation requirements, refer to the [Traces Instrumentation Documentation](https://friendsofopentelemetry.github.io/opentelemetry-bundle/instrumentation/traces.html#components).

This phase will conclude once:

- All components are fully covered by instrumentation.
- Both automatic and selective configuration methods are implemented.

### Stable

To complete the Stable release, the following goals must be met:

- Full compliance with [OpenTelemetry Trace Semantic Conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/trace/).
- Stabilization of tracing instrumentation, incorporating feedback and addressing reported issues.
- Comprehensive test coverage for each component.
- A complete documentation set, covering tracing services, configurations, and bundle capabilities.
