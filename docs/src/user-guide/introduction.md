# Introduction

## Should you use this bundle in production?

No, not yet. This bundle is still in development and should not be used in production or at your own risk.
It misses a few features, and it is not yet tested in a real-world application. It is also not yet optimized for performance.
As long as the release goals are not reached and fully defined, no stable version will be released.
But you are welcome to try this bundle and give feedback or contribute to it.

In case you want to try it, a Symfony demo is maintained on this [repository](https://github.com/FriendsOfOpenTelemetry/symfony-demo).
